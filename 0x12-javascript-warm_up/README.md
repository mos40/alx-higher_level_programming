Background Context
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for various purposes. In this project, you will primarily focus on two aspects of JavaScript:

Scripting: Similar to what you've done with Python, you will explore JavaScript for scripting purposes.
Web Front-end: In the initial stages, the focus will be on learning the basic concepts of JavaScript through scripting. Later, this knowledge will be applied to make your AirBnB project dynamic by using JavaScript and JQuery.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript through scripting exercises. This will serve as a foundation for upcoming tasks, where you will integrate JavaScript into a real-world project.

Guidelines
The project officially starts on Mar 11, 2024, at 6:00 AM and must be completed by Mar 12, 2024, at 6:00 AM.
A checker will be released on Mar 11, 2024, at 12:00 PM for you to validate and assess your work.
An auto review will be conducted automatically at the deadline to evaluate your project submission.
Instructions
Begin by familiarizing yourself with basic JavaScript concepts and syntax.
Complete the scripting exercises provided in the project materials.
Use this opportunity to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript for both scripting and potential web front-end development.
